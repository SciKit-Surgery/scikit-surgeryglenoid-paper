In this paper we introduce SciKit-SurgeryGlenoid, an open source toolkit for the measurement
of Glenoid version. SciKit-SurgeryGlenoid contains implementations of the 4 most    
frequently used glenoid version measurement algorithms enabling easy and unbiased comparison of
the different techniques. We present the results of using the software on 10(?) sets of
pre-operative CT scans taken from patients who have subsequently undergone shoulder replacement surgery.

Here we describe the software and present results based on manual segmentation of 10
patients. We further compare these results with those obtained from a commercial
implant planning software.
