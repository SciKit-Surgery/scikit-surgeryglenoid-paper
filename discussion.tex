\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
We can put some discussion of the results here.

\sksglenoid provides a useful resource for shoulder arthroplasty. Future work could look at either 
automating the segmentation process using state of the art registration algorithms \cite{Fu2020} to create a fully automatic pipeline, or at integrating the library with 3DSlicer to create a 
``slicelet" based application, similar to our previous work \cite{PMID:33937966} in skull base 
navigation.
