\sksglenoid is built on top of the \sksurgery \cite{PMID:32436132} libraries which enabled
rapid development and future deployment into a clinically useable application. 
Development was kick started using the \sksurgery Python Template \cite{doel_tom_2022_5879146} enabling the bulk of the development and testing to be performed during a 10 week summer internship. \sksurgery also includes template libraries for C++ projects \cite{dowrick2021cmakecatchtemplate}.

\sksurgery is made up of multiple Python libraries and currently supports clinical 
guidance systems \cite{schneider2020comparison}, research platforms for registration \cite{thompson2021fiducial} and ultrasound simulation \cite{thompson2020snappysonic}. 
Figure \ref{fig:deps} shows the immediate dependencies of \sksglenoidns.
