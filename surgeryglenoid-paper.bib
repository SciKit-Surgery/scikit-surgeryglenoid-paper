	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Preoperative computed tomography (CT) measurements of glenoid version and inclination are recommended for planning glenoid implantation in shoulder arthroplasty. However, current manual or semi-automated 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) methods are user-dependent and time-consuming. We assessed whether the use of a 3D automated method is accurate and reliable to measure glenoid version and inclination in osteoarthritic shoulders. METHODS:CT scans of osteoarthritic shoulders of 60 patients scheduled for shoulder arthroplasty were obtained. Automated, surgeon-operated, image analysis software (Glenosys; Imascap) was developed to measure glenoid version and inclination. The anatomic scapular reference planes were defined as the mean of the peripheral points of the scapular body as well as the plane perpendicular to it, passing along the supraspinatus fossa line. Measurements were compared with those obtained using previously described manual or semi-automated methods, including the Friedman version angle on 2D CTs, Friedman method on 3D multiplanar reconstructions (corrected Friedman method), Ganapathi-Iannotti and Lewis-Armstrong methods on 3D volumetric reconstructions (for glenoid version), and Maurer method (for glenoid inclination).The mean differences (and standard deviation) and the concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) were calculated. Two orthopaedic surgeons independently examined the images for the interobserver analysis, with one of them measuring them twice more for the intraobserver analysis; interobserver and intraobserver reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS:The mean difference in the Glenosys glenoid version measurement was 2.0° ± 4.5° (CCC = 0.93) compared with the Friedman method, 2.5° ± 3.2° (CCC = 0.95) compared with the corrected Friedman method, 1.5° ± 4.5° (CCC = 0.94) compared with the Ganapathi-Iannotti method, and 1.8° ± 3.8° (CCC = 0.95) compared with the Lewis-Armstrong method. There was a mean difference of 0.2° ± 4.7° (CCC = 0.78) between the inclination measurements made with the Glenosys and Maurer methods. The difference between the overall average 2D and 3D measurements was not significant (p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS:Use of fully automated software for 3D measurement of glenoid version and inclination in arthritic shoulders is reliable and accurate, showing excellent correlation with previously described manual or semi-automated methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The use of automated surgeon-operated image analysis software to evaluate 3D glenoid anatomy eliminates interobserver and intraobserver discrepancies, improves the accuracy of preoperative planning for shoulder replacement, and offers a potential gain of time for the surgeon.},

Ten of the twenty shoulders had osteoarthrosis; eight, rheumatoid arthritis; and two, gouty arthritis. To help determine normal values, computerized tomographic scans of the chest of sixty-three patients who did not have roentgenographic evidence of disease of the shoulder were studied retrospectively for comparison as a control group. In the group of patients who had severe arthritis, the mean glenoid orientation was 11 degrees of retroversion (range, 2 degrees of anteversion to 32 degrees of retroversion). The computerized tomographic scans showed uneven wear of the glenoid surface, osteophytes, large cysts, and posterior displacement of the humeral head. In the control group, the mean orientation of the glenoid was 2 degrees of anteversion (range, 14 degrees of anteversion to 12 degrees of retroversion). The difference between the groups was significant (p less than 0.0001). Glenoid retroversion was increased in the patients who had severe arthritis, and the computerized tomographic scans accurately revealed the extent and pattern of erosion of the bone.},

SciKit-Surgery implements a family of compact, orthogonal, libraries accompanied by robust testing, documentation, and quality control.

The aim is to support translation from single surgeon trials to multicentre trials in under 2 years.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;At the time of publication, there were 13 SciKit-Surgery libraries provide functionality for visualisation and augmented reality in surgery, together with hardware interfaces for video, tracking, and ultrasound sources. The libraries are stand-alone, open source, and provide Python interfaces. This design approach enables fast development of robust applications and subsequent translation. The paper compares the libraries with existing platforms and uses two example applications to show how SciKit-Surgery libraries can be used in practice.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using the number of lines of code and the occurrence of cross-dependencies as proxy measurements of code complexity, two example applications using SciKit-Surgery libraries are analysed. The SciKit-Surgery libraries demonstrate ability to support rapid development of testable clinical applications. By maintaining stricter orthogonality between libraries, the number, and complexity of dependencies can be reduced. The SciKit-Surgery libraries also demonstrate the potential to support wider dissemination of novel research.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The SciKit-Surgery libraries utilise the modularity of the Python language and the standard data types of the NumPy package to provide an easy-to-use, well-tested, and extensible set of tools for the development of applications for image-guided interventions. The example application built on SciKit-Surgery has a simpler dependency structure than the same application built using a monolithic platform, making ongoing clinical translation more feasible.},

After determining intra- and interrater reliabilities, differences in glenoid version values between the conventional and vault methods were assessed. In the normal shoulder group, side-to-side differences of glenoid version values were also evaluated in both methods.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Both measuring methods demonstrated high intra- and interrater reliabilities. The normal glenoid had 1.1° ± 3.2° retroversion with the conventional method and 8.9° ± 2.7° retroversion with the vault method. The average glenoid retroversion of arthritic shoulders was 10.8° ± 9.3° measured with the conventional method and 18.2° ± 9.1° with the vault method. The vault method showed significantly larger glenoid retroversion than the conventional method in both normal and arthritic shoulder groups. Both conventional glenoid retroversion and glenoid vault retroversion were significantly larger on dominant sides than on nondominant sides in the normal shoulders.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The glenoid vault version could be used as an alternative measuring method for glenoid version with high reliability. In clinical use, the glenoid vault version appears to be more useful than the conventional glenoid version to assess the severity of arthritis and difficulty of glenoid replacement.

abstract = {Hypothesis
There is concern regarding the accuracy of 2-dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT) for measuring glenoid version. Three-dimensional (3D) CT scan reconstructions can properly orient the glenoid to the plane of the scapula and have been reported to accurately measure glenoid version in cadaver models. We hypothesized that glenoid version measured by correcting 2D CT scans to the plane of the scapula by 3D reconstruction would be significantly different compared with standard 2D CT scan measurement of the glenoid in a clinical patient population.
Materials and methods
Thirty-four patients underwent dedicated axial 2D CT scan of the shoulder with 3D reconstruction. The 2D glenoid version was measured on unmodified midglenoid axial cuts, and the 3D glenoid version measurement was corrected to be perpendicular to the plane of the scapula and then measured in the axial plane. Three observers repeated each measurement on 2 different days.
Results
The difference between the overall average 2D and 3D measurements was not statistically significant (P = .45). In individual scapulae, 35% of 2D measurements were 5° to 10° different and 12% were greater than 10° different from their corresponding 3D-corrected CT measurement (P < .001 to P = .045). Reproducibility of both 2D and 3D-corrected measurements was good.
Discussion
Although 2D and 3D corrected methods showed a high degree of both intraobserver and interobserver reliability in this series, axial 2D images without correction were 5 to 15 degrees different than their 3D-corrected counterparts in 47% of all measurements. Correcting 2D glenoid version by 3D reconstruction to the transverse plane perpendicular to the scapular body allows for an accurate assessment of glenoid version in spite of positioning differences and results in increased accuracy while maintaining high reliability.
Conclusions
Owing to the variability in scapular position, the axial 2D CT scan measurement was significantly different from 3D-corrected measurement of glenoid version. Averaging the version measurements across patients did not reflect this finding.}
