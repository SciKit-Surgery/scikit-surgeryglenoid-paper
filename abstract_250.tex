Correct understanding of the geometry of the glenoid (the socket of the shoulder joint) is 
key to successful planning of shoulder replacement surgery. This surgery typically involves 
placing an implant in the shoulder joint to restore joint function. The most relevant 
geometry is the glenoid version, which is the angular orientation of the glenoid surface 
relative to the long axis of the scapula in the axial plane. However, measuring the glenoid version is not 
straightforward and there are multiple measurement methods in the literature and used in 
commercial planning software.

SciKit-SurgeryGlenoid currently requires manual segmentation of the relevant anatomical 
features for each method. Future work will look at automating the segmentation process
 to build an automatic and repeatable 
pipeline from {CT} or radiograph to quantitative glenoid version measurement.
