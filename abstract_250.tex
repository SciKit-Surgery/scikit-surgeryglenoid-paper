SciKit-SurgeryGlenoid is an opensource toolkit for the measurement of Glenoid version 
designed for applications in reconstructive shoulder surgery. The toolkit implements
5 methods of Glenoid version measurement and quantification of shoulder joint 
arthrosis taken from the literature. 

Here we describe the software and present results based on manual segmentation of 10 
patients. 

Future work will look at automating the segmentation process to build a largely automatic
pipeline from {CT} or radiograph to quantitative glenoid version measurement.
